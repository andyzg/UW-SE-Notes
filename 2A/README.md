2A Notes
================

Make sure you have LaTeX installed before trying to run the below commands

Build all of the PDFs with 
`make`

Build a specific course with
`make COURSE_NUMBER`

Ex: `make ECE222`

If you want to test a specific file, use test.sh
`./test.sh COURSE_NUMBER CLASS_NUM`

CLASS_NUM should usually be like 1.tex, 2.tex or however you think it should be named.
