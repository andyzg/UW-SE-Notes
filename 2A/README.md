2A Notes
================

PS: Most of these are incomplete. They're written based on what I think is
worth writing i.e. things to memorize. If there are already good notes out
there, I won't bother writing them.

Make sure you have LaTeX installed before trying to run the below commands

Build all of the PDFs with
`./make.sh`

Build a specific course with
`./make.sh COURSE_NUMBER`

Ex: `./make.sh ECE222`

If you want to test a specific file, use test.sh
`./test.sh COURSE_NUMBER CLASS_NUM`

CLASS_NUM should usually be like 1.tex, 2.tex or however you think it should be named.
