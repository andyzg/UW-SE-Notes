\chapter{Module 4 - Theories}
  \section{Definitions}
    \paragraph{Enthymeme} is an argument that contains a hidden premise, that
    is, an argument that contains unstated premises that are obviously true

    \paragraph{Theory}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item A set of statements or principles devised to explain a group of
      facts or phenomena, especially one that has been repeatedly tested or is
      widely accepted and can be used to make predictions about natural
      phenomena
      \item A set of theorems that constitute a systematic view of a branch of
      mathematics
    \end{itemize}

    \paragraph{Leibnizs Law} if $t_1 == t_2$ is a theorem, then so is $P[ t_1 / x ]
    \Leftrightarrow P[ t_2 / x ]$\\
    Lebinizs Law is generally referred to as the ability to substitute equals
    for equals

    \paragraph{Normal interpretations} are interpretations in which the symbol
    == is interpreted as equality on the objects of the domain.

    \paragraph{Induction}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item $P(0)$ is called the base case
        \item $P(k)$ is called the induction hypothesis
        \item $\forall k \wedge P(k) \Rightarrow P(suc(k))$ is called the
        induction proof or inductive step
      \end{itemize}

    \paragraph{Deduction} is showing a conclusion follows frmo the stated
    premises using rules of inference

    \paragraph{Philosophical induction} is the process of deriving general
    principles from particular observations

    \paragraph{Recursive function} is one that is defined in terms of itself
    and certain terminating clauses
